Double-click a file, make changes, and save it back to disk:
That’s how productivity apps, IDEs, and image editors have been working since the early days of desktop computing.
Until now, web applications could not integrate into this workflow.
Fortunately, Project Fugu, a cross-vendor initiative by Google, Microsoft, and Intel, aims to bring very powerful native capabilities to the web—clipboard and file system access included!
This allows web developers like you to finally bring Office-style apps, IDEs, text, image, or video editors to the web.
Thinktecture’s Christian Liebel shows you how to integrate the File System Access and Async Clipboard API into your Angular app.

## Setup Instructions

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
